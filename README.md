# CodeTogether
CodeTogether is a real-time collaborative coding platform with multi-language execution capabilities.
## Key Features
* **Real-Time Collaboration:** Users can create rooms and code together in a shared IDE using WebSockets.
* **Multi-Language Support:** Support for running code in multiple languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, C++, Java).
* **Code Execution with Output Sharing:** Users can execute their code directly within the editor using the Judge0 API. Outputs and errors are displayed in a terminal-like section for everyone in the room to see.
* **Enhanced Workflow:** Teams can debug, optimize, and refine their code collaboratively in one environment, eliminating the need for external tools.
